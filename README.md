# Analyzing Twitter Data ML

In todayâ€™s digital age, understanding how organizations are perceived on social media platforms like Twitter is invaluable. This project aims to conduct a sentiment analysis using OpenAI models to gauge these perceptions. Sentiment Analysis, a key application of Natural Language Processing (NLP), helps in determining the emotional tone behind a series of user-generated review texts, categorizing them as Positive, Neutral or Negative. Before diving into the implementation, it is crucial to understand how these OpenAI models, such as large language models (LLMs), are practically utilized for various purposes.

This project aims to:
- Analyze sentiments in user reviews on Twitter and categorize sentiments as Positive, Neutral or Negative to understand public perception better.
- Demonstrate the practical use of OpenAI models in sentiment analysis for social media analytics.

The dataset has been collected from the Kaggle:
